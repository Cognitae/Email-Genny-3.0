EmailGenny Application ReadMe
Welcome to EmailGenny, a simple and intuitive application designed to help you generate formatted emails with ease.

Overview
EmailGenny uses predefined templates and user input to create emails. The application allows you to select from three email templates, each catering to a different scenario, and input relevant information into the provided fields to generate your email.

Using the Application
The user interface consists of various text entry fields and buttons. Here's what each one does:


The user inputs are the values that the user enters in the fields of the graphical user interface (GUI). 
They are used to customize the email body according to the specific information of the company, contact, craft, module, images, and video. The user inputs affect the email body in the following ways:

The company name is used to form the subject line and to address the company in the email body.
The contact name is used to greet the person in the email body.
The craft is used to specify the NCCER curriculum that the images or video are related to.
The module is used to specify the exact module within the craft curriculum that the images or video are related to. 
	If the module is not provided, a generic sentence is used instead.
The number of images is used to determine the grammatical number and quantity of the images in the email body. 
	For example, if there is only one image, singular nouns and articles are used, such as “this image” and “a”. If there are multiple images, plural nouns and articles are used, such as “these images” and “some”. 
	The number of images also affects how many times the word “Here” is repeated in the email body, which indicates where the images are attached or linked. 
	If there are more than 15 images, only one “Here” is used. If there are more than two images, a comma-separated list of "Here"s is used with an “and” before the last one. If there are only two images, an “and” separates the two "Here"s.
The video is used to specify the name or title of the video that is related to the craft curriculum. If the video is provided, it replaces the module in the email body. 
Note:	If both the module and video are provided, an error message is displayed and no email body is generated.

Once you've filled out the necessary fields, you can select a template and hit the "Generate Email" button. The application will then populate the email body in the large text box at the bottom of the application. 
You can also see the generated subject line in the smaller text box below.

Templates
EmailGenny provides three templates, each designed for a specific scenario:

Initial Email: This template is for when you're reaching out to a contact for the first time.
In The Past: Use this template when you've had previous interactions with the contact.
No Reply: This template is ideal for when a contact hasn't responded to your previous emails.
The templates are editable. Click the "Edit Templates" button to open a new window where you can modify the templates as you see fit. 
After editing, hit the corresponding "Save Template" button to keep your changes. A success message will pop up to confirm the save.

Additional Features
You can copy the generated email and subject line to your clipboard by clicking the "Copy" button beside each respective field.

The application also includes a Dark Mode feature, which you can toggle on and off using the switch in the bottom left corner of the application.

That's all there is to it. Enjoy using EmailGenny!

(Note: Always review and proofread the generated email before sending, as the application may not catch context-specific errors or nuances.)
